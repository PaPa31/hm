Won't be available. ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Splice"),". Won't be available. You need these two methods for the tasks 5 and 6 so.

The split method on your text a passing an empty string as argument to it. So if t input by user for example stored in a userInput property, userInput.split with parenthesis (and in the parenthesis just an empty string) will split into an array of characters. And you can call map on after them. And the same for the splicing. You can get splice something on such a convert of array and then will join add an empty string as an input, you can turn it back into the text. This will be important for task 6.
