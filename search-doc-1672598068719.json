GE 645 (photo description) GE 645 The operator console is front and center, with a Selectric mechanism and a little panel to the right that has the speedometer and the boot button. Front left is a GE-645 CPU. Another CPU is near the back of the room by the door. To the left of the rear CPU are two x-shaped configurations of cabinets: these are GIOCs. I guess those are memory boxes to the left of the GIOCs. The three-bay cabinets behind the front CPU, on the left side, may be Librafile ('firehose') drums, with drum controllers behind them. The MIT configuration had two PRT202 printers (not four), two card readers, two punches. I have no idea what the device is on the extreme right front, that appears to have three tape reels. I also do not see the RACE file which was installed in the Tech Square machine room for a while but never used. See the detailed configuration memo from 1967. MISTRAM The GE-600 line of computers was developed by a team led by John Couleur out of work they had done for the military MISTRAM project in 1959.

When Linus Torvalds first started writing his Linux operating system kernel (1991), he was working on a machine running MINIX, and adopted its file system layout. This soon proved problematic, since MINIX restricted filename lengths to 14 characters (30 in later versions), it limited partitions to 64 megabytes, and the file system was designed for teaching purposes, not performance. The Extended file system (ext; April 1992) was developed to replace MINIX's, but it was only with the second version of this, ext2, that Linux obtained a commercial-grade file system. As of 1994, the MINIX file system was &quot;scarcely in use&quot; among Linux users. On 17 September 1991, Torvalds prepared version 0.01 of Linux and put on the &quot;ftp.funet.fi&quot; ‚Äì FTP server of the Finnish University and Research Network (FUNET). It was not even executable since its code still needed Minix for compilation and play. It was originally authored in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his i386-based PC, and it was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system, which was written to be a free (libre) replacement for UNIX. After that, despite the limited functionality of the early versions, Linux rapidly gained developers and users. Many people contributed code to the project, including some developers from the MINIX community. At the time, the GNU Project had created many of the components required for its free UNIX replacement, the GNU operating system, but its own kernel, GNU Hurd, was incomplete. For this reason it soon adopted the Linux kernel as well.
