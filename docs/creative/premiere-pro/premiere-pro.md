## Studio and Game Ready Drivers

I play games (RDR2, Cyberpunc2077 etc.) and I have Game Ready Driver(GRD) installed.

If you want video rendering, you need to uninstall GRD and install Studio Driver (SD) <a href='https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/multi/drivers-video-win-nvidia.html' class='external'>helpx.adobe.com</a>.

I reinstalled Studio Driver and didn't understand the difference between SD and GRD during video rendering.
