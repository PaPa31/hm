Manage multiple installations of `node.js` on a Windows computer.

## Installation

1. Install `cURL` (a tool used for downloading content from the internet in the command-line) with:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install curl
    ```

2. Check the most recent release at <a href='https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm' class='external'>github.com: Node Version Manager</a>.
Adjust the below command to include the newest version:

   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
   ```

3. To verify installation, enter:

    ```bash
    command -v nvm
    ```

    this should return `nvm`, if you receive `command not found` or no response at all, close your current terminal, reopen it, and try again. <a href='https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm' class='external'>Learn more in the nvm github repo</a>.

2. List which versions of `node` are currently installed (should be none at this point):

    ```bash
    nvm ls
    ```

3. Install two version of `node`:

    1. Current release of node.js (for testing the newest feature improvements, but more likely to have issues):

        ```bash
        nvm install node    # "node" is an alias for the latest version
        ```

    2. The latest stable LTS release of node.js (recommended):

        ```bash
        nvm install --lts
        ```

4. List what versions of `node` are installed:

   ```bash
   nvm ls
   ```

   now you should see the two versions that you just installed listed.

5. Verify that `node.js` is installed and the currently default version with:

    ```bash
    node --version
    ```

    Then verify that you have npm as well, with:

    ```bash
    npm --version
    ```

    (You can also use `which node` or `which npm` to see the path used for the default versions).

## Change Version of Node

To change the version of `node.js` you would like to use for a project, create a new project directory:

```bash
mkdir NodeTest  # create the directory 

cd NodeTest     # enter the directory

nvm use node    # swith to the Current version or

nvm use --lts   # switch to the LTS version
```

You can also use the specific number for any additional versions you've installed, like:

```bash
nvm use v8.2.1
```

 To list all of the versions of `node.js` available, use the command:

```bash
nvm ls-remote
```

:::tip
If you are using `nvm`to install `node.js` and `npm`, you should not need to use the `sudo` command to install new packages.
:::

## Set the Default Node Version

To set a default `node` version to be used in any new shell, use the alias 'default':

```bash
nvm alias default node

# in my case
nvm alias default 12

# and if you don't want restart shell
nvm use 12
```

## Updating

Installing the newer version of `nvm` using `cURL` will replace the older one, leaving the version of `node` you've used nvm to install intact. For example:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.36.0/install.sh | bash
```

:::caution
Remember to check the most recent release at <a href='https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm' class='external'>github.com: Node Version Manager</a> and adjust the above command to include the newest version.
