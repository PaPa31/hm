## Sorting Error

:::warning If you put more than 10 files in any folder, among which there are, for example, .pdf files, you may get a wrong sorting of files. :::

To fix this error, you need to put the .pdf files in a separate folder inside.

## Update Docusaurus

:::tip After [updating Docusaurus to `2.0.0-beta.6` version](update-docusaurus), this plugin **is not needed**! :::

## Need a Deeper Sort

:::caution But I added zero manually to the folder names and file names (in courses) for proper sorting. :::

To make thing easier, I wrote the [updateAutoFrontmatter](../../vs-code/macros/2-auto-frontmatter) macro.
