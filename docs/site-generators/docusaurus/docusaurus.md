I found another way to make the page look like _index.js_ and _README.md_ pages.

### Make "folder duplicate" page

You must create a new file with a name of the parent folder.

:::important

You must then make sure to add the _.md_ extension in the link to that page. Otherwise, you will get a broken link.

:::

When you build your website, this duplicate page will be converted to the _parent folder_ page.
