# Just_the_Docs

> I remembered that I can just fork any GitHub project to run it remotely! Fork and run as GitHub Pages to see working project online.

[Just-theDocs Home page](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/)

Simple Jekyll theme. Can start remotely.

[Use any theme with GitHub Pages](https://github.blog/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/)

> Starting today(2017-11-29), you can use any of [the hundreds of community-curated themes on GitHub.com.](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme) To build your site with any public, GitHub-hosted theme, add the following to your siteâ€™s **_config.yml** file:
>
>`remote_theme: owner/name`

for example: _**just-the-doc theme**_

_config.yml:

    remote_theme: pmarsceill/just-the-docs

One only line!!!

Very simple!  
It's fascinated with its simplicity! But maintaning is very poor. 

And need a very hard folder configuration and file frontmatters.
