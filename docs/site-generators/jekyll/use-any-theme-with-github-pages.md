I remembered that I can just fork any GitHub project to run it remotely! Fork and run as GitHub Pages to see working project online.



## [Use any theme with GitHub Pages](https://github.blog/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/)

> Starting today(2017-11-29), you can use any of [the hundreds of community-curated themes on GitHub.com.](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme) To build your site with any public, GitHub-hosted theme, add the following to your siteâ€™s **_config.yml** file:
>
>`remote_theme: owner/name`

for example: _**just-the-docs theme**_

```yaml title="_config.yml"
remote_theme: pmarsceill/just-the-docs
```

One single line!!!

Very simple!  

## About Just_the_Docs theme

[Just-the-Docs Home page](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/)

Simple Jekyll theme. Can start remotely.

It's fascinated with its simplicity! But maintaning is very poor. 

And need a very hard folder configuration and file frontmatters.
