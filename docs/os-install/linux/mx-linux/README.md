- Download last [MX Linux distro](https://mxlinux.org/mx-linux-blog/)

MX LInux is the most popular Linux distro in the world (see distros rank).

It comes in three versions:

- XFCE (midweight desktop environment)
- KDE (with advanced desktop “Plasma”)
- Fluxbox (lightweight and fully functional system)

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

In this section, we will introduce the following concepts:

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
