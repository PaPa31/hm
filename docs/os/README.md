## Linux

In the 1980s, [GNU](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=glossary#gnu) project formed a mostly complete [Unix](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=glossary#unix)\-like operating system. Most of the pieces of the operating system were in place and functioning, with the notable exception of a [kernel](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=glossary#kernel).

In the early 1990s, Linus Torvalds created the [Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=glossary#linux) kernel. Developers from around the world began to use the GNU Operating System with the Linux kernel. The combination of the two (GNU and Linux) is called GNU/Linux or a GNU/Linux distribution.

GNU/Linux is:

- Linux kernel
- <a href='https://www.pathname.com/fhs' class='external' title='hi'>file system</a> with Linux Filesystem Hierarchy
- wide range of Unix utilities (many of which have been developed by the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation)
- other utilities are designed to achieve compliance with the POSIX (IEEE 1003.1) standard
