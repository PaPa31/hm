## Debian (Stable)

Community-supported Debian Project, which was established by Ian Murdock in 1993. The Debian <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian#Branches' class='external'>Stable branch</a> is the most popular edition for personal computers and servers. Debian is also the basis for many other distributions, most notably Ubuntu.

But the most popular Linux distro in the world (see <a href='https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity' class='external'>distros rank</a>) is MX Linux.
