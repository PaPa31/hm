## For Polyglot

I write a phrase. Suppose in English. In a special code block. After I typed "." (dot) or other punctuation mark, signifying the end of the sentence ("!", "?", "..."), this new phrase becomes a sentence. This new sentence is immediately wraps by HTML tags, and highlights. Like in the form of an e-mail message, when you type addressee (destination) and press the tab key.
