The myth is the result of people playing "telephone" (or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers' class='external'>en.wikipedia.org: "Chinese whispers"</a>).

One person said: Hermes was fast.  
The second said: Hermes was faster than the wind.  
3: Hermes was flying.  
4: Hermes had wings on his feet.  
5: Hermes was a god. They were all gods.

And then came [cuneiform](../writing-system/cuneiform). And this fact was recorded in history.
