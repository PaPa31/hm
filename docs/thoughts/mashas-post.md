Good Movie
Finally I found a normal movie about "Queen" in Russian. Such a feeling, that everyone only cares, when Freddie got AIDS, who infected him, how he died and what orientation he was. I'm much more interested in seeing their creative process, how they created their hits. There is such a film. Called him "A Night at the Opera". And the voice on the voice acting is good, which is also very rare. For me personally it is very important.
