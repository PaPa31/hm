1. Create TWO new components: `UserInput` and `UserOutput`
2. UserInput should hold an `input` element, UserOutput two `paragraphs`
3. Output multiple UserOutput components in the `App` component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
4. Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via `props` and display it there
5. Add `state` to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
6. Add a `method` to manipulate the `state` (=> an event-handler method)
7. Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and `bind` it to the `input-change event`
8. Ensure that the new input entered by the user `overwrites` the old username passed to UserOutput
9. Add `two-way-binding` to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
10. Add `styling` of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with `inline` styles and `stylesheets`
