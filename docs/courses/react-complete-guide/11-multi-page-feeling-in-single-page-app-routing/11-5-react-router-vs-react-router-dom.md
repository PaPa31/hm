We installed both `react-router`  and `react-router-dom` . **Technically, only `react-router-dom`  is required for web development**. It wraps `react-router`  and therefore uses it as a dependency.

We **don't need to install** `react-router`  on our own for it to work. You can omit this installation step, I left it in there for historic reasons and because I like to emphasize that the main package is named react-router. If you ever search for assistance, you probably want to search for "react router" - that's the name of the package.
