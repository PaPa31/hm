  ! PLEASE HELP US HELP YOU !

  Make it obvious to understand and reproduce this bug.
  Ideally, we should be able to understand it without running any code.

  Bugs are fixed faster if you include:
  - a repro repository to inspect the code
  - an url to see the problem live (if possible)

  Pro tip: create a reproducible demo of the bug with https://new.docusaurus.io

### Prerequisites

<!--
IMPORTANT: Please check the following items before creating a issue.
Mark the checkbox by putting an X between the bracket.
This way we know you've done these steps first.
-->

- [x] I'm using the latest version of Docusaurus.
- [x] I have tried the `npm run clear` or `yarn clear` command.
- [x] I have tried `rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock package-lock.json` and re-installing packages.
- [x] I have tried creating a repro with https://new.docusaurus.io
- [x] I have read the console error message carefully (if applicable)

### Description

I have a working `2.0.0-alpha.72` Docusaurus version. I tried to update Docusaurus to `2.0.0-beta.6` version, but I got the error:

```bash
Invalid sidebar file at "sidebars.auto.js".
```

I have these dependencies in `package.json`:

```bash
 "dependencies": {
    "@docusaurus/core": "^2.0.0-beta.6",
    "@docusaurus/preset-classic": "^2.0.0-beta.6",
    "@docusaurus/remark-plugin-npm2yarn": "^2.0.0-beta.6",
    "@docusaurus/theme-live-codeblock": "^2.0.0-beta.6",
    "@mdx-js/react": "^1.6.21",
    "clsx": "^1.1.1",
    "docusaurus-lunr-search": "^2.1.10",
    "docusaurus-plugin-auto-sidebars": "^1.0.7",
    "react": "^16.8.4",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.4"
  },
```

and I understand that this dependency: `"docusaurus-plugin-auto-sidebars": "^1.0.7"` is probably causing this error. But I can't stop using this plugin. My site is big. And I want that it will more and more. And

Yes

## Steps to reproduce

Use https://new.docusaurus.io to create a CodeSandbox reproducible demo of the bug.

**I get an error**: Only a max of 500 modules is allowed in a sandbox

My Docusaurus site is big. I counted 513 articles.

If you want to reproduce my situation, you can just fork my [repo](https://github.com/PaPa31/hm) (github.com/PaPa31/hm), open package.json, change 4 lines (from `2.0.0-alpha.72` to `2.0.0-beta.6`) and run `npm ci` (analogous `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` and `npm install`, but in only one command). And run: `npm start`.

## Expected behavior

<!--
  How did you expect your project to behave?
  It‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre not sure your understanding is correct.
  Write down what you thought would happen.

I don't know.

## Actual behavior

<!--
  Did something go wrong?
  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?
  Describe this section in detail, and attach screenshots if possible.
  Don't only say "it doesn't work"!
  Please submit exhaustive and complete log messages (we also need the error strack-traces, not just the message).
  Please read error messages carefully: it often tells you exactly what you are doing wrong

1. Remove trash ...

```bash
/mnt/sdc2/Yandex.Disk-parsh/hm ‚ëÇdocumentation* $ rm -rf node_modules/ package-lock.json
```

2. Install dependencies ...

```bash

npm WARN deprecated resolve-url@0.2.1: https://github.com/lydell/resolve-url#deprecated
npm WARN deprecated chokidar@2.1.8: Chokidar 2 will break on node v14+. Upgrade to chokidar 3 with 15x less dependencies.
npm WARN deprecated querystring@0.2.0: The querystring API is considered Legacy. new code should use the URLSearchParams API instead.
npm WARN deprecated mkdirp@0.3.0: Legacy versions of mkdirp are no longer supported. Please update to mkdirp 1.x. (Note that the API surface has changed to use Promises in 1.x.)
npm WARN deprecated uuid@3.4.0: Please upgrade  to version 7 or higher.  Older versions may use Math.random() in certain circumstances, which is known to be problematic.  See https://v8.dev/blog/math-random for details.

<!--
  What happens if you skip this step?

  Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you,
  but it‚Äôs unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually,
  the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos.

  Please remember that:

    * Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.
    * The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
    * You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.

  Thanks for helping us help you!
