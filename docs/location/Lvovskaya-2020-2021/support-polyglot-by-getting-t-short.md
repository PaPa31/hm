I found it in the <a href='https://parceljs.org/' class='external'>Parcel</a>.

```html
ðŸ‘• Support Parcel by getting an awesome t-shirt or hoodie! All proceeds support our Open Collective. âœ¨
```

Clicking on this link will take you to <a href='https://cottonbureau.com/products/parcel-t-shirt#/5175094/tee-men-standard-tee-vintage-navy-tri-blend-s' class='external'>cottonbureau.com</a> where you can purchase a T-short.

What if we make it for [Polyglot](https://www.english-polyglot.com/)?

And we will combine it with your project [Anti-Modelier](https://my-clothes.netlify.app/).

And then we'll just make an e-commerce site. First, with the products of our own production, and then (if things go uphill) with the products of local Orenburg mothers and grandmothers.

And afterwards you become the most famous anti-modelier in the world: [Angry Mary](https://angry-mary.netlify.app/).
