## After copy/past

I bought a new disk, and reinstall Windows 10. And I just copied the RDR2 from the old SSD to the new NVMe disk. RDR2 can be started without the additonal steps. But it started from the begining (if you press `ok` when popup about graphic driver). To avoid this and to start from 'game map' you need copy/past one file (for example, `SRDR30015`) from this folder:  
```
F:\parsh\Documents\RDR2-backup-to-Users-parsh-AppData-Roaming-Golderg-RDR2\0F74F4C4
```

to folder in the above folder name:

```
C:\Users\parsh\AppData\Roaming\Golderg-bla-bla-bla\RDR2\0F74F4C4
```

The game stars but suddenly aborts after 10 minutes.
