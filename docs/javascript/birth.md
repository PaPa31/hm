## Born in 1995

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. JavaScript was first released with the `Netscape Navigator 2` browser in early 1996.

## 1st edition (ES1) in 1997

It was originally called `LiveScript`. But at this time, another language was popular - Java. And marketers decided to name the new language - `JavaScript`. To increase sales. Despite the fact that these two languages have very little in common. This was the source of the confusion.

A few month later, Microsoft released `Jscript` with Internet Explorer 3. Netscape sent JavaScript to ECMA International (European Standards Organization). And 1st Edition (ES1) of JavaScript was released in June 1997.  
All editions <a href='https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/' class='external'>www.ecma-international.org</a>  
`ES1` is also known as `ECMAScript 1`  and `ECMAScript 1997`.

## Editions

- ES1 (1997) first edition
- ES3 (1999) with significant updates - stable edition
- ES4 was dropped due to political differences of language complexity
- ES5 (2009) with many part of ES4
- ES6 (2015) major edition of the standard

## Input/Output

Unlike most programming languages, JavaScript has no concept of input or output. It is designed as a scripting language in the host environment, and it is the host environment that must provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world.

## Browser and more

`Browser` is the most common host environment. But not only.

JavaScript interpreters can be found in:

- Adobe Acrobat
- Adobe Photoshop
- SVG images
- server-side environments as Node.js
- NoSQL databases as open source Apache CouchDB
- embedded computers
- complete desktop environments like GNOME (GUI for GNU/Linux)
- Yahoo's widget engine
- and others
