description: What flavor of Regex does Visual Studio Code use?
---

I was faced with the need of massively change `(a)` to `a)`, `(b)` to `b)` and so on. After I changed `(a)` to `a)` using Fined/Replace, instead of continuing the tedious manual replacement letter by letter, I remembered about `regular expressions`.

I had some experience with [regular expressions in bash](../../shells/bash/regex-in-bash) and I was able to make the required expression pretty soon.

There are some differences in how ***regex***(regular expressions) work in VS Code though.

As mentioned in [Regarding Find/Replace with Groups](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42179046/what-flavor-of-regex-does-visual-studio-code-use#42184299) the grouping is done a little differently:

- instead `\( \)` you need to use `( )`
- and instead `\1` you need to use `$1`

And my finished regex was like this:

- Find: `\((.)\)`
- Replace: `$1)`
