## TODO 

- Google `ssh dreamhost`
- Make pair keys ([last time I made them like this](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216499537-How-to-configure-passwordless-login-in-Mac-OS-X-and-Linux))
- Copy/past the contents of the pub key into the file `/home/papa31/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the dreamhost server manually
- Don't change the settings file: `F:\Yandex.Disk-visi\english-polyglot\english-polyglot.com\.vscode\sftp.json`
- All you have to do is make sure that you have dobe your jod correctly (especially when copying/pasting the contents of the pub key)
