I got this error after a sudden power outage. I was in Windows. After a reboot, I couldn't save any file on Linux:

```shell
touch /file

Error: Permission Denied
```

I read link below and many others on a search query: `read-only file system` but without success. But after `unmount/mount` my disk `/mnt/sdc2/` in KDE Partition Manager, the problem was gone!
