`Chocolatey` a package manager for Windows. It will make the work of installing the rest of the programs easier.

Chocolatey needed to [install pandoc](./pandoc-install) or to install [VirtualBox](../../virtual-machines/docker/install-docker-software#install-virtual-box) for Docker.

```sh title="PowerShell (as admin)"
