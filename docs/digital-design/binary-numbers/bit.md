description: How much information is in a bit
---

The *amount of information* D in a discrete valued variable with N distinct states is measured in units of *bits* as

D = log<sub>2</sub>N bits

A binary ~~variable~~(?) conveys log<sub>2</sub>2 = 1 bit of information. Indeed, the word bit is short for ***b***inary dig***it***.

:::tip Bit Definition
A bit is two discrete values of information
:::

Not to be confused with positions in binary numbers. Or how many bits of a binary number does it take to include this value.

One digit - is zero information! Fine!
