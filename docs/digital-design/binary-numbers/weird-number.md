title: Weird Number in Two's Complement
---

![Weird Number](weird-number-in-twos-complement.svg)

The binary number 100..000<sub>2</sub> is called a _weird number_ because after inverting and adding 1 (taking the two's complement) it does not change.

```
100..000  inverting
011..111
+ 1
------------
100..000
```

This number (100..00<sub>2</sub> = -2<sup>N-1</sup>) is the _most negative_ of two's complement numbers. And it has no positive counterpart.
