To capture video, you will need:

- powerful computer
- video driver
- video capture app

## Powerful Computer

For example, I render 1GB video on my Linux (KDE Plasma, Kdenlive video editor) and it take 4 hours 15 minutes. And I did same on Windows 10 (Premiere Pro, Nvidia GeForce driver)

A powerful computer is:

- fast disk
- fast processor
- fast GPU
- fast memory amount

### Fast Disk

Disk is a device that is always used. These are the blood channels in you system.

### Fast Processor

The processor is the brain of your system. The faster the processor, the faster all programs run.

### Fast GPU

The GPU is the muscle in you computer. The GPU controls two main creative processes: video capture and video rendering.

## Video Driver

I have Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3GB GPU. For capturing I need to use `Game Ready Driver` for rendering - `Studio Driver`.

I make a clean installation.

### Capture

I need to <a href='https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/multi/drivers-video-win-nvidia.html' class='external'>reinstall Nvidia driver</a> this time with `GeForce Experience` app to capture video.
