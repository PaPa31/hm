A couple of weeks ago, I stumble upon [Multipass](https://multipass.run), a tool that allows you to spin up Ubuntu VMs in a matter of seconds on a Mac, Linux, or Windows workstation.

Depending upon your OS, Multipass uses Hyper-V, HyperKit, KVM, or VirtualBox natively for the fastest startup time.

In this short article, we’ll set up a K3s Kubernetes cluster on virtual machines created with Multipass.

## Getting Multipass

Just head up to [Multipass](https://multipass.run/), and download the binary for your platform. Once installed, you can get the list of the available commands. We’ll only use a couple of them in this article.

```
$ multipass  
Usage: multipass \[options\] <command>  
Create, control and connect to Ubuntu instances.This is a command line utility for multipass, a  
service that manages Ubuntu instances.Options:  
  -h, --help     Display this help  
  -v, --verbose  Increase logging verbosity, repeat up to three times for more  
                 detailAvailable commands:  
  delete    Delete instances  
  exec      Run a command on an instance  
  find      Display available images to create instances from  
  get       Get a configuration option  
  help      Display help about a command  
  info      Display information about instances  
  launch    Create and start an Ubuntu instance  
  list      List all available instances  
  mount     Mount a local directory in the instance  
  purge     Purge all deleted instances permanently  
  recover   Recover deleted instances  
  restart   Restart instances  
  set       Set a configuration option  
  shell     Open a shell on a running instance  
  start     Start instances  
  stop      Stop running instances  
  suspend   Suspend running instances  
  transfer  Transfer files between the host and instances  
  umount    Unmount a directory from an instance  
  version   Show version details
```

## **Creation of the VMs**

First, we create three VMs, keeping the default configuration of one CPU and 1GB RAM.

```
$ multipass launch -n node1  
$ multipass launch -n node2  
$ multipass launch -n node3
```

Next, we verify the three VMs are in the running state

```
$ multipass list  
Name         State             IPv4             Image  
node3        Running           192.168.64.13    Ubuntu 18.04 LTS  
node2        Running           192.168.64.12    Ubuntu 18.04 LTS  
node1        Running           192.168.64.11    Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
```

**Note:** In this example, I use Multipass on MacOS, so the VMs are run on HyperKit as I can confirm listing the HyperKit-related processes.

```
luc@saturn:~$ ps aux | grep -i "\[h\]yperkit"  
... com.docker.hyperkit ...  
... com.canonical.multipass/bin/hyperkit...  
... com.canonical.multipass/bin/hyperkit...  
... com.canonical.multipass/bin/hyperkit...
```

Among those processes, the first one is the Docker daemon already running on my machine. The next three are the VMs created above.

## Initialize K3s on node1

First, we run a command on `node1` (using the _exec_ subcommand of Multipass) to install K3s as defined in the [documentation](https://k3s.io).

```
$ multipass exec node1 -- \  
  bash -c "curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -"
```

**Note:** The K3s initialisation took less than 30 seconds … really impressive for a certified Kubernetes distribution.

Then, from the local machine, we gather the elements we’ll need to add additional nodes to the cluster:

*   The token to join the cluster

```
$ TOKEN=$(multipass exec node1 sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token)
```

*   The IP of the API server running on `node1`

```
$ IP=$(multipass info node1 | grep IPv4 | awk '{print $2}')
```

## Join node2 and node3 to the Cluster

From the local machine, we run the following commands to add `node2` and `node3` to the cluster.

```
# Joining node2
$ multipass exec node2 -- \
bash -c "curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=\"https://$IP:6443\" K3S_TOKEN=\"$TOKEN\" sh -"
# Joining node3
$ multipass exec node3 -- \
bash -c "curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=\"https://$IP:6443\" K3S_TOKEN=\"$TOKEN\" sh -"
```

As we can see, those commands use the TOKEN and IP address we defined above.

## Get the Cluster Configuration

Running the following command, we can list all the nodes of the cluster:

```
$ multipass exec node1 -- sudo kubectl get nodes  
NAME    STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION  
node1   Ready    master   5m31s   v1.16.2-k3s.1  
node3   Ready    <none>   21s     v1.16.2-k3s.1  
node2   Ready    <none>   45s     v1.16.2-k3s.1
```

To access the cluster’s API server from our local machine, we only need to get the `kubeconfig` file created on `node1` during the setup.

```
$ multipass exec node1 sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml > k3s.yaml
```

We then need to change the `server` key so it references the remote IP address of `node1` instead of the localhost.

```
sed -i '' "s/127.0.0.1/$IP/" k3s.yaml
```

Finally, we configure our local kubectl so it uses the kubeconfig file (k3s.yaml) we’ve just retrieved. A simple way is to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable so it points towards the configuration file.

```
export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/k3s.yaml
```

We’re all set, we can now communicate with the cluster from your local machine.

```
$ kubectl get nodes  
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION  
node1 Ready master 10h v1.16.2-k3s.1  
node2 Ready <none> 10h v1.16.2-k3s.1  
node3 Ready <none> 10h v1.16.2-k3s.1
```

## Summary

Multipass is a very useful tool. Its integration with low-level hypervisors makes it a good choice to deploy multiple VMs locally and to play with many distributed solutions such as the great K3s Kubernetes distribution.

>Hi. I’m curious, why you put “h” in square brackets for this command? `ps aux | grep -i “\[h\]yperkit”`

>Very simple and completely automated. Thank you! (I followed a different article first, but it had some missing instruction and crashed my nodes!, but yours works!)
